Costco Wholesale Corp. will build a large store on the vacant Showcase Cinemas property.

The company will construct a 153,000-square-feet members-only retail warehouse on 17.73 acres at 3408 Bardstown Road, according to plans submitted by Costco (NASDAQ: COST) to Louisville-Jefferson County Metro Government. The project also will include a tire center and a freestanding gas station.

The property was sold in September for $3.3 million to Playa Plaza, a partnership associated with Louisville-based Kaden Companies, as Business First previously reported.

Issaquah, Wash.-based Costco operated 671 warehouse stores as of December 2014, according its annual report, including 474 in the United States. Net income for 2014 was $2.06 billion, and sales were $110 billion — both records. The company said in the report that it planned to open 20 new warehouse stores in the United States.
